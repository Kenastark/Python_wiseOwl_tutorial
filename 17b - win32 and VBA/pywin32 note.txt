Microsoft VBA COM (Component Object Model) allows VBA applications to talk to each other, which means python applications can talk to VBA too.

If you are going to write a program within Excel VBA, the objects you will be maniputlating will be workbooks and Chats. 

If you are working within PowerPoint, you'll be manipulating Presentations

If you are working within Word, you'll be manipulating Documents, characters and tables.

Within Projects, you'll be working with Gnatt charts, timelines.

Within Access, you'll be working with Tables and recordsets, etc.

Each of these applications has a COM which says what sort of thing that that applications provides which you can manipulate in other programs.
