# Python_wiseOwl_tutorial

This is a repo for my python tutorial class from WiseOwl. This is where tested and practiced my code.
I will periodically add more python scripts to it to cover new topics and libraries not yet covered in it.


Feel free to use it for your python learning experience and leave a ‚≠êÔ∏è if you find it useful‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
