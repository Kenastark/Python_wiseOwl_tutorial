# ITERATING OVER SEQUENCES

# Main sequences in Python
# 1. Ranges (sequnces of numbers)
# 2. Strings(sequences of letters or characters)
# 3. Lists(mutable sequences of things) meaning they can be Changed
# 4. Tuples (immutable sequences of things) meaning they cannot be changed

# RANGES

# 1 arg
# ranges start at 0
# first_ten = range(10)

# for i in first_ten:
#     print(i)

# 2 arguments
# ranges miss out the last term

# for j in range(1,11):
#     print(j)

# 3 arguments
# for k in range(3,100,3):
#     print(k)

for m in range(10,0,-1):
    print(m)


#For item in list:
    # put item in trolley

# list is the set of things you are iterating over
# item' is a variable which points to each item in the list one by one
